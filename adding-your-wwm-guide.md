## Adding Your Work With Me Guide

1. Fork [workwithme.guide-myguide](https://github.com/abloomston/workwithme.guide-myguide) on GitHub.
2. Modify `index.md`, optionally adding a profile picture to the top level directory.
3. Fork [this project]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) on GitHub.
4. Clone your fork. In your local sandbox run `git submodule add -b master https://github.com/USERNAME/workwithme.guide-myguide.git WWM_LINK` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username and `WWM_LINK` is the link you'd like at `workwithme.guide/WWM_LINK`. If you don't specify `WWM_LINK`, your link will end up being `https://workwithme.guide/workwithme.guide-myguide`
5. Make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to this repo `abloomston/workwithme.guide`, not `pages-themes/minimal`. This is how you will make changes to your Work With Me Guide (for now--this is a prototype).
6. Once I merge your Pull Request your Work With Me Guide will be available at `https://workwithme.guide/WWM_LINK`.
